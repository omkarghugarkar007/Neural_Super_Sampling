Model file contains the model Generator and Discriminator code
Train file contains the code to train the model
Test file contains the code to train the model. To test, simply add your image in the input folder of the test_image folder and change the path accordingly in the code

SRGAN is based on the Paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802
Improvement is inspired by the Paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219

## Comparison of Both the Results
